# Kameko Studio — Gemini Context

## What This Project Is

Kameko Studio is a one-person web game studio. All games are mobile-first progressive web apps built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no frameworks, no backend, no build step. Everything is static files deployed on GitHub Pages at https://yevrap.github.io/KamekoStudio/.

The studio is a solo creative project with serious engineering habits: version control, clean code, documented decisions. Pace is roughly one hour per day.

See `docs/mission.md` for the full studio philosophy.

## Stack Constraints

- **Vanilla JS only** — no React, Vue, or other frameworks unless complexity demands it
- **No backend, no database** — all data lives in the browser (localStorage, IndexedDB)
- **No build step** — source files are served directly; no bundlers or transpilers
- **Three.js (CDN)** is acceptable for 3D games; currently loaded from cdnjs r128
- **No Tailwind** — `index.html` was redesigned with plain CSS custom properties; Tailwind is no longer used anywhere
- **GitHub Pages hosting** — everything must work as static files

## Project Structure

```
index.html          — Main arcade dashboard (dark arcade theme, custom CSS)
3d.html             — 3D interactive landing page (Three.js), links to all games
shared/
  settings.js       — Global settings panel + token system (included in every page)
  utils.js          — Pure utility functions (tested; loaded by keypad-quest)
tests/
  keypad-quest.test.js  — Unit tests (node --test tests/)
  README.md             — How to run tests
GEMINI.md           — This file
README.md           — GitHub Pages URL
docs/               — Design docs and studio notes
  mission.md        — Studio philosophy and principles
drafts/             — WIP files not yet in production (see drafts/CLAUDE.md)
  arcadeHome.html   — Alternate arcade home, not yet linked
games/              — One subdirectory per game (see games/CLAUDE.md)
  blob-zapper/
  durak/            — index.html + style.css + game.js (single game.js)
  durak-dungeon/    — index.html + style.css + ES modules (constants/state/ui/gameplay/main.js)
  durak-tactics/    — index.html + style.css + ES modules (constants/state/gameplay/main.js)
  hidden-object/
  keypad-quest/     — index.html + style.css + ES modules (constants/state/fx/deck-manager/rendering/gameplay/input/main.js)
  materials-run/
  river-run/
  waterfall/
```

**Per-game file convention:** Modern games use **Native ES Modules** (`type="module"`) split by concern — `constants.js`, `state.js`, `ui.js` (or equivalent), `gameplay.js`, `main.js`. See `games/CLAUDE.md` for the full file table and rationale. `games/durak-dungeon/` is the reference implementation. Older single-file `game.js` games are acceptable until they grow unwieldy; they are candidates for the module split when they exceed ~800 lines. Classic `<script>` tags (no `type="module"`) remain correct for `shared/settings.js` and `shared/utils.js`.

**Local testing note:** `type="module"` requires HTTP, not `file://`. Use `npx serve .` from the project root or VS Code Live Server.

## Shared Infrastructure: `shared/settings.js`

Every page includes this script before `</body>`:
```html
<script src="[relative-path]/shared/settings.js" data-gallery-depth="N"></script>
```
- `data-gallery-depth="0"` for root pages (`index.html`, `3d.html`)
- `data-gallery-depth="2"` for games (`games/<name>/index.html`)

**What it provides:**
- Gear button (⚙) injected fixed top-right on every page
- Settings overlay with: dark mode toggle, Back to Gallery link, token count + Get Token button
- Dispatches `window` events: `settingsOpened` / `settingsClosed` — games listen to these to pause/resume
- `window.KamekoTokens` global: `.get()`, `.add(n=1)`, `.spend()` (returns false if 0), `.toast(msg)`
- Dark mode: `localStorage` key `theme` = `'dark'` | `'light'`, applied as `body.dark-mode` class
- Token count: `localStorage` key `tokens` = integer

**Developer Mode:**
The settings panel includes a "Developer Mode" toggle. When enabled, this mode does two things:
- It adds a blue glow to the settings gear icon as a visual indicator.
- It shows a "Clear All Game Data" button in the panel. This button removes all known `localStorage` keys related to game progress, settings, and tokens, which is useful for testing from a clean state.

**Per-game settings injection:** Games can append their own sections to `#settings-panel` on `settingsOpened`. Use `insertBefore(section, document.getElementById('dev-mode-section'))` to keep content above the developer tools:
```js
window.addEventListener('settingsOpened', () => {
    const panel = document.getElementById('settings-panel');
    const devSection = document.getElementById('dev-mode-section');
    if (!document.getElementById('my-section')) {
        const sec = buildMySection();
        if (devSection) panel.insertBefore(sec, devSection);
        else panel.appendChild(sec);
    }
});
window.addEventListener('settingsClosed', () => {
    document.getElementById('my-section')?.remove();
});
```
See `games/river-run/index.html` for a pill-toggle example; see `games/keypad-quest/game.js` for a stats + "Back to Menu" button example.

**Settings gear positioning:** The gear is injected as `position:fixed; top:15px; right:15px`. Games with a top header bar should override this in their CSS to align it within the header and add right padding to the header so content doesn't slide under it:
```css
#settings-gear-btn {
  position: fixed !important;
  top: 6px !important; right: 8px !important;
  width: 42px !important; height: 42px !important;
  border-radius: 10px !important;
}
#header { padding-right: 58px; } /* clear the gear */
```

## Token System

Each game costs 1 token to play. Pattern for gating game start:
```js
startButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
    if (!window.KamekoTokens || !window.KamekoTokens.spend()) {
        if (window.KamekoTokens) window.KamekoTokens.toast();
        return;
    }
    localStorage.setItem('lastPlayed_myGame', Date.now()); // for dashboard
    startGame();
});
```
Tokens are free to add via the settings panel (no real economy — it's a casual mechanic).

## Mobile-First Patterns

All games must work on phone, tablet, and desktop. Key patterns used across the codebase:

- **Pointer events** (`pointerdown`, `pointermove`, `pointerup`) not mouse/touch events — handles both input types uniformly
- **`touch-action: none`** on game canvases/grids to prevent scroll hijacking
- **CSS custom properties** with `@media` breakpoints for responsive sizing
- **`position: fixed`** for full-screen overlays (game over, start screen) so they stay anchored on mobile scroll
- **44px minimum tap targets** for buttons
- **Dark mode** via `body.dark-mode` class + CSS custom properties; `settings.js` owns the toggle and the localStorage key
- **iOS Safari viewport fix** — use `height: 100dvh` (dynamic viewport) with `height: 100vh` as fallback; add `viewport-fit=cover` to the meta viewport tag to enable `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)`; subtract the safe area from heights that need to stay above the home indicator
- **iOS PWA bfcache** — when users navigate back on iOS (browser or home-screen app), `DOMContentLoaded` does not re-fire; listen to `pageshow` with `event.persisted === true` to refresh dynamic content
- **Canvas size zero bug** — on mobile, `canvas.clientWidth/Height` can be 0 during the first few frames before layout completes; always guard dimension updates with `if (cw > 0 && ch > 0)` and skip rendering if dimensions are still 0

## Keypad Quest — Architecture Notes

Keypad Quest (`games/keypad-quest/`) is the most complex game in the studio. Key patterns to know:

- **Three input modes:** Tap to Spell (T9 scroll-select), T9 Smart (guided per-char typing), Keyboard. Mode persisted in `keypadQuest_inputMode`. The mode selector (`.mode-btn` buttons) lives in the settings panel — injected by `injectInputModeSection()` on `settingsOpened`, removed on `settingsClosed`. Click handling uses document-level delegation; `setInputMode()` updates active state via `querySelectorAll('.mode-btn')`.
- **T9 Smart:** Each key press is validated against the next expected character (`t9pos` integer). Special characters are auto-inserted; leading non-alphanumeric chars are auto-skipped on prompt show. User must press OK to submit when complete.
- **Tap to Spell:** Mirrors T9 Smart — `autoFillScrollSpecials()` appends consecutive specials after each confirmed char. User must press OK to submit when complete.
- **Mode switching preserves input progress:** `setInputMode()` converts typed progress across modes — `t9buf.length` (scroll) / `t9pos` (predict) / alphanumeric char count in `ki.value` (keyboard). Pending scroll char (`t9pend`) is always cleared. `t9timer` (scroll auto-confirm) is cancelled on mode switch.
- **Keyboard mode:** Uses a near-invisible fixed `<input>` (1×1px, opacity 0.01) at viewport center so focusing it never causes scroll/layout shift on mobile. `ki.value` stores **alphanumeric chars only** — the `input` handler strips anything else. Display shows the same answer template as other modes (specials always visible, alphanum positions filled from `ki.value`). On submit, `buildKeyboardAnswer(typed)` reconstructs the full answer by inserting typed chars into the alphanum slots of the template, so users never need to type `(`, `)`, spaces, hyphens, etc. Submit handlers clear `ki.value` **before** calling `submitAnswer(buildKeyboardAnswer(...))`. `showNextPrompt()` also clears `ki.value`.
- **Skip button:** Skips current question, resets streak (no other penalty). Calls `showNextPrompt()`.
- **Circular enemy path:** Enemies travel an ellipse (`pathCX/CY/RX/RY`) by `e.angle` in radians/sec. Slots are in two rings around the ellipse. `pathRX/RY` are derived from available canvas room to prevent top-slot clipping.
- **Built-in decks:** `BUILTIN_DECKS` array, ids `b-capitals`, `b-math`, `b-elements`. Not in localStorage.
- **User decks:** `keypadQuest_decks` — `[{id, name, pairs:[{k,v}]}]`. IDs prefixed `u-`.
- **Active deck selection:** `keypadQuest_activeDeckIds` — array of IDs from built-in + user decks.
- **Deck share/import:** Plain text format (`# Name\nkey: value`). Share links use `?import=<base64-json>` — parsed on `init()`, URL cleaned with `history.replaceState`.
- **Wave flow:** Continuous — `endWave()` calls `startWave(wave+1)` immediately. No summary screen. `startWave` only calls `showNextPrompt()` if `currentPair === null` (i.e. game start / checkpoint resume) — wave transitions never disturb the active question.
- **Settings panel:** On `settingsOpened` during a run, injects input mode selector + "Current Run" stats section above `#dev-mode-section`. Both removed on `settingsClosed`.

## Testing

Pure utility functions are extracted to `shared/utils.js` and covered by Node.js tests.

**Run:** `node --test tests/` — requires Node.js 18+
**Coverage:** `parsePlainText`, `deckToPlainText`, `typeForStreak`, `shuffle`, `lerpHex`

Browser-side logic (game loops, DOM state, T9 input state machine) is not unit-tested — verify by running the game in a browser.

## Development Notes

- Each game is self-contained in its own directory — editing one never affects others
- When adding a new game: create `games/<name>/` with `index.html` + `style.css` + `game.js`, add a card to `index.html`, add a portal link to `3d.html`, include `shared/utils.js` + `settings.js`, add token gate + `lastPlayed` write, and add `settingsOpened`/`settingsClosed` pause/resume listeners
- Inline `//` comments inside single-line JS functions comment out everything after them including closing braces — avoid this pattern; it causes silent syntax errors
- Game state in materials-run uses a `gameState` string: `'menu'`, `'playing'`, `'gameover'`, `'won'`
- All scores stored in localStorage; no server-side persistence anywhere
- `obstacles` arrays in Three.js games store `{ mesh, boundingBox }` objects — access position as `obs.mesh.position`, not `obs.position`
